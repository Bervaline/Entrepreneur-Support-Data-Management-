# Entrepreneur-Support-Data-Management

## Problem
Lack of a clear data management tool to manage the entrepreneus and to get clear real time update of how the funds have been used and how to support the start-ups at hand.

## Solution
Develop a data management tool that allows HEVA to store data collected from various sources/ activities, and analyze the data to make strategic decisions.
